<p>When buying things online, you probably use a credit or debit card. It’s fast and convenient. But when making larger purchases, it makes sense to look at all available options.</p>

<p>I live in Romania, which has an obscure currency (RON). That means I have to pay a sizable conversion fee any time I want to buy something from abroad.</p>

<p>Most Romanian banks have a foreing exchange spread of at least 3%, which means I’m paying a 1.5% fee each way. For sums larger than €10.000, you can negotiate a better transaction rate, but for smaller sums you’re out of luck (unless you have very high volume).</p>

<p>Besides the conversion fee, banks also charge a transaction fee of 0.1% or more. This fee can’t be lowered, at least not for mere mortals.</p>

<h2 id="the-promise-of-cheap-international-transfers">The Promise of Cheap International Transfers</h2>

<p>TransferWise guarantees a total fee of exactly 1% for RON transfers, making it cheaper than using most banks. That was reason enough for me to give it a try.</p>

<p>At first, TransferWise was just another money transfer service, similar to Western Union or Moneygram - you could send funds to a specific person, but not to a specific bank account. You can ask a family member to go pick up the cash, but you can hardly ask online shops or business partners to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Recently, however, they fixed this problem by introducing a feature called a “borderless account”. This is just a collection of regular bank accounts in various countries, managed in one place.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-a-transferwise-account">Setting up a TransferWise account</h2>

<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>

<p>Signing up for an account is a breeze. Before I can make any transfers, I have to upload two documents: a proof of identity and a proof of address.</p>

<p>I already had a picture of my national identity card, so I use that as proof of identity. For proving my address, I just generat a statement from my local bank and upload it.</p>

<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>

<p>My account is approved. I activated the currencies I’d be using most often, namely RON, USD and EUR.</p>

<p><img alt="TransferWise Balances" src="/assets/img/transferwise-borderless.png" class="full-width" /></p>

<h2 id="making-my-first-transfer">Making my first transfer</h2>

<p>I transfer RON into my TransferWise account from my domestic bank. It has a trivial fee (5 RON).</p>

<h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3>
<p>Convert RON to USD - As promised, the fee is 1%, minus the fees for getting funds in and out of TransferWise.</p>

<p>Initiate USD transfer to a bank in the United States.</p>

<h3 id="day-4">Day 4</h3>

<p>Check up on the transfer status and notice the site is only partially loading. Turns out they recently did a redesign and were having some trouble with their servers.</p>

<h3 id="day-5">Day 5</h3>

<p>Get an email saying my transfer bounced back. It turned out that their UI silently “corrects” bank account numbers that contain letters.</p>

<p>The only option the UI presented was to fix the recipient details. Given that the account I was trying to send funds to wasn’t acceptable to the system, I had to call Transferwise support to get them to cancel the transfer.</p>

<h2 id="giving-it-another-go">Giving it another go</h2>

<h3 id="day-6">Day 6</h3>

<p>The funds show up in my borderless account again.</p>

<p>I do another conversion, from USD to EUR, incurring another 1% fee.</p>

<p>I initiate a transfer from my EUR balance to another EUR account within <abbr title="Single Euro Payments Area">SEPA</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="day-7">Day 7</h3>

<p>I see the funds in the destination account.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I had the bad luck of conducting my experiment during a period when the website was experiencing some technical difficulties. Assuming this only happens once in a blue moon, I’m not going to hold that against them.</p>

<p>I <em>am</em> however dissapointed that transfers to virtual accounts don’t work. At the very least, I would have expected my transfer request to be rejected immediately, instead of the UI silently changing the transfer details and then having to wait 2 days for the transfer to bounce back.</p>

<p>Other than that, TransferWise seems like a good service: transparent fees, friendly user interface and decent phone support.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about my experience, feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:cristi@efficiencing.eu">cristi@efficiencing.eu</a> or a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/EfficiencingEu">@EfficiencingEu</a>.</p>

<p>And if you’d like to try TransferWise yourself, consider using <a href="https://transferwise.com/u/silviu-cristianb">this affiliate link</a>. You’ll get a free transaction and I’ll eventually get L250 (I’m not sure what “L” stands for).</p>
