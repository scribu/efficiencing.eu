<p>Let’s say you already have some experience selling stuff online through an existing marketplace, like Amazon, Etsy etc. But what if that marketplace doesn’t serve customers in a region you’re interested in? Or what if they don’t offer a feature that’s essential for your type of product?</p>

<p>Both of those are excellent reasons for starting your own online store! <span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short guide I’ll give you a high-level overview of all the things you’ll need to take care of in order to have a successful independent online shop. Let’s get started.</span></p>
<h3>1. Decide who your ideal customer is.</h3>
<p>Before you do anything else, make sure you have a clear idea of who you want to sell to. The more specific it is, the easier it will be to tailor everything to their needs and differentiate yourself from the competition.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you’re <em>too</em> specific, the market might not be big enough to justify the investment. Still, it’s easier to start from a very narrow niche and gradually expand, than the other way around.</p>
<h3>2. Build your brand.</h3>
<p>A brand is just a name that people come to associate with certain traits, either positive or negative. You can influence this both through the quality of service you offer, as well as through the image you project.</p>

<p>To that end, you will need to choose an appropriate name and get a logo. You don’t need to spend a fortune on this, but it pays to have a professional designer handle this for you.</p>

<p>Once you have those basics down, you can make the design of your store fit the brand.</p>
<h3>3. Build the store.</h3>
<p>There are actually several levels of automation you could go for. Each level requires more sophisticated software and services:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Online product catalog: Users can see a list of your products online, but ordering is manual. They have to place an order via phone, email or other type of message.</li>
	<li>Online shopping cart: Users can add products to a shopping cart and make an order, but they have to pay on delivery or via bank transfer.</li>
	<li>Online payment: Users can both make orders and pay for them online, through a payment gateway. I'll talk more about gateways in a future blog post.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can start directly at the last level, but it’s not mandatory.</p>
<h3>4. Attract customers to your store.</h3>
<p>On an established marketplace, you have a built-in audience. But when you’re running your own shop, you will have to attract potential buyers yourself.</p>

<p>The most important sources of online traffic are search engines (primarily Google) and social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit etc.).</p>

<p>It boils down to figuring out where your customers are and how to talk their language. There are various software tools that can help you with this, but expect to put some serious effort into this area.</p>
<h3>5. Optimise the shopping experience.</h3>
<p>Once you have people visiting your store, you can start to analyse their behaviour and make sure they’re finding what they’re looking for.</p>

<p>The first step is installing a web analytics service, such as Google Analytics. This will allow you to see where your visitors are coming from, what pages they’re looking at and so on.</p>

<p>The next step is doing what’s called A/B testing. Basically, you present two versions of a page to different users and see which version gets a better reaction. It’s a very powerful technique, but also involves some subtle statistics.</p>
<h3>6. Keep in touch with customers.</h3>
<p>After a visitor makes a purchase, you should do at least these two things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ask them for feedback. What did they like and what caused frustration?</li>
	<li>Ask them to join your newsletter. This gives you a way to send them promotions later on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, both of these steps are integrated into your purchase flow. If you’d have to manually do this for each customer, you probably wouldn’t bother and you’d miss a big opportunity to gain loyal customers.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There you have it. I’ve only just scratched the surface, but I hope I’ve given you some idea about what’s needed to break out on your own. Good luck!</p>
